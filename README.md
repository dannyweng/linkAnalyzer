# Link Analyzer - Python 3  

## You need to complete the following steps to have the script run properly.  
It is important to not expose your API Keys!!!  
To handle this concern, I have hidden the 'config.py' from future git commits.
### Create a file named 'config.py' on the root directory of this repo and add the following (replace 'API-KEY' with your keys):  

```
urlScanAPIKey = 'API-KEY'
vtAPIKey = 'API-KEY' 
```

Make sure you have python 3 and dependencies installed.  
Run the command below to install the dependencies:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main script file is linkAnalyzer.py  
To run the script,  
Open CMD, PowerShell or terminal and enter :  

```
python linkAnalyzer.py
```

#### Tools to be intergrated:  
- unshorten.me
- UrlScan.io
