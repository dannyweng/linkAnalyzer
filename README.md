# Web Scan Tools - Python 3

## You need to complete the following steps to have the script run properly.
It is important to not expose your API Keys!!! 
To handle this concern, I have hidden the 'config.py' from future git commits.
### Create a file named 'config.py' on the root directory of this repo and add the following (replace 'API-KEY' with your keys):

```
urlScanAPIKey = 'API-KEY'
vtAPIKey = 'API-KEY' 
```

Make sure you have python 3 and dependencies installed.
Run the command below to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The main script file is web_scan_tool.py
To run the script, open CMD, PowerShell or terminal and enter :
```
python web_scan_tool.py
```

#### Tools to be intergrated:
- unshorten.me
- UrlScan.io
- VirusTotal
