# Web Analytics Tools

It is important to not expose your API Keys!!! 
In order to handle this concern, create a file named config.py on the root directory of this repo and add the following (replace 'API-KEY' with your keys):
```
urlScanAPIKey = 'API-KEY'
vtAPIKey = 'API-KEY' 
```
Tools to be intergrated:
UrlScan.io
VirusTotal
