### You need to complete the following steps to have the script run properly.  
It is important to not expose your API Keys!  
To handle this concern, I've placed the API keys in a file named 'config.py'.
#### Create a file named 'config.py' on the root directory of this repo and add the following (replace 'API-KEY' with your keys):  

```
urlScanAPIKey = 'API-KEY'
vtAPIKey = 'API-KEY' 
```
