# Web Scan Tools - Python 3

### You need to complete this step to make your script work
It is important to not expose your API Keys!!! 
In order to handle this concern, I have hid the 'config.py' from future git commits.
### Create a file named 'config.py' on the root directory of this repo and add the following (replace 'API-KEY' with your keys):

```
urlScanAPIKey = 'API-KEY'
vtAPIKey = 'API-KEY' 
```

Make sure you have python 3 installed.
The main script file is web_scan_tool.py
To run the script, open cmd or powershell and enter :
```
python web_scan_tool.py
```
